# Javascript Image Gallery

This was created by Austin Tolani for CSE204 Web Devlopment to demonstrate a basic understanding of Javascript. 

Users can click on an image in the image gallery causing it to display centered on the user's page. Clicking the right and left arrows will cycle through the images in the gallery.
